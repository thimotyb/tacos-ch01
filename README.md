# Taco Cloud (Chapter 1)

This repository contains the code from chapter 1 of *Spring in Action*, building the initial Taco Cloud web application with Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Thymeleaf. It demonstrates the project structure, configuration, and the first UI flows for designing and submitting taco orders.

The codebase has been refactored to Spring Boot 3.x and Spring Framework 6, targeting Java 17. Testing now relies on JUnit Jupiter and Selenium 4 with the HtmlUnit driver.

The repository also includes branches that illustrate two refactoring workflows:

- The `claude-refactoring` branch contains refactoring work performed with support from Claude.
- The `codex-refactoring` branch captures refactoring iterations implemented with Codex.

Use these branches to compare how each assistant supports refactoring activities in the project.
